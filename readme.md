# Speech Search

Search for speeches in the target language from a specified country.

While studying at the Middlebury Chinese School in Vermont, I learned the importance of large-structured data (speeches with subtitles in native language, longer than 20-minutes, full speeches, complete speeches) are of great use to a language learner. They can sit and watch and listen, almost passively, for hours. They can write the language, or practice writing its script while listening. The important part is the long part, and playing lofi in the background. The first step though is finding the correct search term. This app helps you find the search term for target language in target country, meaning you have the prompt searching for youtube videos translated into Spanish, say, in order to find speeches of historical leaders in Bolivia, thereby learning the sound of Bolivian Spanish, and perhaps sayings and key cultural context. Working on adding indigenous languages.
